# **Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews**  

This project implements **sentiment analysis** using **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** techniques to classify movie reviews as **positive, negative, or neutral**. The goal is to process unstructured text data, extract meaningful features, and train classification models to predict the sentiment of each review.

## **Tech Stack**

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language for building the project.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for feature extraction and building classifiers.
- **nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Converts text data into numerical features.
- **Naive Bayes and SVM**: Machine learning algorithms used for classification.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud-based development environment for coding and collaboration.

## **Features**

- **Text Preprocessing:** 
  - Removes punctuation, converts text to lowercase, tokenizes, and removes stopwords.
- **Feature Extraction:** 
  - Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert reviews into numerical form for model input.
- **Classification Models:**
  - Implements **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifiers.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** 
  - Outputs **accuracy score** and a **classification report** with precision, recall, and F1-score.

## **Benefits**

1. **Scalable and Automated Analysis:**  
   Automates the sentiment analysis of large volumes of reviews, eliminating the need for manual reading.  
2. **Improved Decision-Making:**  
   Helps platforms like Netflix or Amazon identify audience reactions and improve content recommendations.  
3. **Proactive Issue Detection:**  
   Identifies negative sentiment early to help brands respond to user concerns in real-time.  
4. **Versatile Solution:**  
   Can be extended to other text-based sentiment use cases, such as product reviews or social media posts.  
5. **Brand Reputation Management:**  
   Helps brands track public opinion trends and address customer feedback proactively.

## **Usage**

1. **Prepare the Dataset:**  
   Optionally, you can store additional datasets inside the `data/` folder.

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

3. **Expected Output:**  
   The console will display:
   - A **classification report** (precision, recall, and F1-score) for each class.
   - The **overall accuracy** of the classifier.

---

## **Evaluation Metrics**

- **Accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** Measures the correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Measures how well the model identifies positive instances.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall for better evaluation in imbalanced datasets.
