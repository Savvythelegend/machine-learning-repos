# AI Code Reviewer

The **AI Code Reviewer** is a Python script designed to analyze and provide feedback on programming code. It utilizes a combination of rule-based checks and code style analysis to detect common coding errors, suggest improvements, and evaluate overall code quality. Additionally, it performs comment analysis to identify areas where code comments may need enhancement.

## Features

- **Indentation Error Detection**: Checks for indentation errors in loops, conditionals, and function definitions.
- **Undefined Variable Detection**: Identifies variables that are used but not defined within the code.
- **Code Style Checking**: Utilizes the `pycodestyle` library to check for code style violations and provides feedback on formatting issues.
- **Comment Analysis**: Analyzes code comments to suggest improvements for better readability and clarity.

## Prerequisites

Before running the AI Code Reviewer script, ensure that you have the following:

- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  
- **Pycodestyle**: Install the `pycodestyle` library, which is required for code style checking. You can install it via pip with the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install pycodestyle


## Usage
- Clone the repository or download the "ai_code_reviewer.py" script.
- Run the script, and it will analyze the Python code provided within the script.
- The AI Code Reviewer will output feedback on any coding errors, style issues, or comment suggestions.
