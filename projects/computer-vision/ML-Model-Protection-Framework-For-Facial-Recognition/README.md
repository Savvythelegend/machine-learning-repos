## Project Overview

This project addresses the security challenges of deploying ML models for face authentication in a browser context. Our goal is to safeguard the ML model from reverse engineering and tampering while ensuring that security measures do not significantly impact the modelâ€™s size or degrade the user experience.

## Description

The application provides a proof of concept for face authentication using TensorFlow.js and FaceMesh in a browser environment. It integrates a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for secure handling of the ML model, employing AES-256 encryption for data protection and obfuscation techniques to optimize model size and security.

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection**:
   - The frontend uses TensorFlow.js and the FaceMesh model to detect faces via the webcam.
   - An encrypted message containing the face data is sent to the web server.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - The web server forwards the encrypted data to the TEE server for decryption and authentication.

3. **Model Security**:
   - The TEE server decrypts the data using AES-256 encryption.
   - The model is obfuscated and snapshotting is used to minimize its size and improve load times.

4. **Authentication**:
   - Based on the decrypted data, the TEE server checks if the face authentication is successful.
   - The result is sent back to the web server and then displayed to the client.

## Technologies, Frameworks, and Tools

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - JavaScript
  - TensorFlow.js
  - FaceMesh

- **Backend**:
  - Flask
  - MongoDB (for potential data storage)

- **Security**:
  - AES-256 Encryption
  - Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
  - Obfuscation
  - Snapshotting

## Unique Selling Points

- **Secure Model Handling**: Utilizes Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to protect against tampering and reverse engineering.
- **Efficient Encryption**: Employs AES-256 encryption for secure data transmission.
- **Optimized Model Size**: Integrates obfuscation and snapshotting techniques to minimize model size impact.
- **Real-Time Authentication**: Leverages TensorFlow.js and FaceMesh for accurate face detection directly in the browser.
- **Seamless Integration**: Maintains user experience with minimal performance overhead while ensuring robust security.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the TEE server**:
    ```bash
    python tee_server.py
    ```

2. **Start the Web server**:
    ```bash
    python web_server.py
    ```

3. **Access the application**:
    Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You will see the registration and login pages.

4. **Test the application**:
    - **Register**: Enter a username and click "Register" to save the face image.
    - **Login**: Enter the username and click "Login" to authenticate with the captured face image. Successful login will redirect to the home page.

## Troubleshooting

- **Video not appearing**: Ensure that the webcam is properly connected and permissions are granted for the browser to access it.
- **Issues with image capture**: Check the browser console for errors related to the webcam or canvas.
