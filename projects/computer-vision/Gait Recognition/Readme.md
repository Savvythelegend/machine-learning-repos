# Gait Recognition Project
## Description
The Gait Recognition project focuses on recognizing individuals based on their walking patterns. Gait recognition is a biometric authentication technique that identifies people by analyzing the unique way they walk. This technique has a wide range of applications, including security, surveillance, and even healthcare for detecting abnormalities in walking patterns.

This project uses OpenCV for video processing and image extraction, and Machine Learning for classifying the gait patterns of different individuals.
## Features
- **Video Processing**: Extract frames from video to analyze walking sequences.
- **Pose Estimation**: Track key points of the human body to model the walking pattern.
- **Gait Classification**: Classify individuals based on their walking patterns using machine learning models.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Can be adapted to different datasets of gait sequences for training and testing.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:
- OpenCV for video and image processing:
```
pip install opencv-python

```
- Numpy for numerical operations:
```
pip install numpy

```
- scikit-learn for training the classification models:
```
pip install scikit-learn

```
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional) for deep learning models (if using advanced classification):

```
pip install tensorflow

```
or
```
pip install torch torchvision

```

## How to Run
- Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
- Clone the project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gait-recognition.git

```

- Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd gait-recognition

```
- Prepare the dataset:
  - Place video files of individuals walking into the data/ folder.
  - Ensure that the videos are named appropriately for each individual (e.g., person_1.mp4, person_2.mp4).
- Run the script to extract gait features and classify individuals:
```
python gait_recognition.py

```
## How It Works
Gait recognition works by extracting frames from a video sequence, detecting the human body in each frame, and then tracking key points such as the head, shoulders, hips, and feet. These key points form a "pose" for each frame, and the sequence of poses over time is used to capture the unique walking pattern (gait) of an individual.
## Step-by-Step Process:
- Frame Extraction:
The video is processed to extract individual frames. Each frame is analyzed to detect the person in the scene.
- Pose Estimation:
  - The key points of the human body are detected using a pose estimation model (such as OpenPose or the PoseNet model from TensorFlow).
  - These key points (like the head, shoulders, and knees) are tracked over time, forming a sequence of body movements.
- Feature Extraction:
The relative positions of key body points are extracted from each frame to form a feature vector for each step in the walking cycle.

- Classification:
Machine learning models (such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or Neural Networks) are used to classify the feature vectors based on the unique walking patterns of different individuals.
- Prediction:
Once the model is trained, it can classify the gait of new individuals based on their walking patterns.
