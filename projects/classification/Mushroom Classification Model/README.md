### 🧾 Description
A mushroom classification model is a machine learning system designed to identify and categorize mushrooms based on their physical characteristics. The model aims to determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous by analyzing features such as cap shape, color, gill size, stem texture, and spore print color.
