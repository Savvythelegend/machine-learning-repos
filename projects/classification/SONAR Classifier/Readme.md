# **Sonar Classifier** ðŸ“¡

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To develop and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying sonar signals, distinguishing between objects such as mines and rocks based on sonar data.

### ðŸ§µ Dataset :  [LINK](https://github.com/Archi20876/machine-learning-repos/blob/main/Classification%20Models/SONAR%20Classifier/sonar_data1.csv)

### ðŸ§¾ Description
Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is a technology that uses sound waves to detect, locate, and identify objects underwater. It works by emitting sound pulses (or "pings") and listening for echoes that bounce back from objects. The time it takes for the echoes to return helps determine the distance, size, and location of the object.

### ðŸ“š Libraries Needed
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- Logistics Regression
