# Stress Prediction / Human Stress Prediction

This project aims to predict human stress levels based on various input features using machine learning techniques. It leverages data from various sources, including physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors, to predict stress levels and provide actionable insights for stress management.

## Overview
Stress is a natural response of the human body to various stimuli, but chronic stress can have negative impacts on mental and physical health. The goal of this project is to predict stress levels based on various features and data points, helping individuals and organizations take proactive measures to manage stress.

This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data and predict whether an individual is stressed, mildly stressed, or relaxed based on factors such as:
- Heart rate
- Sleep patterns
- Physical activity levels
- Environmental factors (noise, temperature, etc.)
- Behavioral indicators (social interactions, work environment)

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Primary programming language
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library for building models
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Optional) – For deep learning models
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Flask/Django** (Optional) – For creating a web app interface

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pratik-Tech-Wizard/stress-prediction.git
cd stress-prediction
```
### Step 2: Install dependencies
Install all necessary Python dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

After setting up the project, you can run the model and input features to predict stress levels.

### Step 1: Train a Model
Use the training data (if available) to train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```
This will train the machine learning model using the provided data and save the trained model for future predictions.

### Step 2: Run Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict stress levels for new data:

```bash
python predict_stress.py --input_data "path_to_input_file"
```
Make sure to replace "path_to_input_file" with the actual path to your input data file (e.g., CSV, JSON). This file should contain the relevant features (e.g., heart rate, sleep data, etc.) for the prediction.

### Step 3: Web Interface (Optional)
If you have built a web interface using Flask or Django, you can run the server to make predictions via a web app:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will start the server, and you can access the web interface at http://localhost:5000 (or any other configured port) in your browser.

### Key Highlights:
- **Usage Section**:
  - Clearly breaks down the steps for training the model, running predictions, and optionally setting up a web interface.
  - Each step includes formatted bash commands to be copied and run easily by the user.
  
- **Contributing Section**:
  - A structured guide on how to contribute, including all necessary Git commands for forking, cloning, branching, committing, and pushing changes.
  - Simple, easy-to-follow instructions for potential contributors.

This should provide clear guidance for setting up and contributing to the project. You can copy this directly into your `README.md` file. Let me know if you'd like further modifications!
